 * This workflow computes the adjustments or promotions for a draft order. It's used by other workflows
 * to compute new adjustments for the promotions whenever changes are made to the draft order.
 * Created adjustments are "virtual" meaning they live on the action and no line item adjustments records are created
 * in the database until the edit is confirmed.
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around
 * computing the adjustments for a draft order.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await computeDraftOrderAdjustmentsWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     order_id: "order_123",
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Refresh the promotions in a draft order.
