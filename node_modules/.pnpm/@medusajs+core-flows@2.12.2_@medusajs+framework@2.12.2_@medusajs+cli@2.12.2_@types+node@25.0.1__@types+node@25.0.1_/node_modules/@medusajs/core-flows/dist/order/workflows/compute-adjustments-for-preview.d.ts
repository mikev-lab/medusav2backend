 * This workflow computes adjustments for an order change if the carry over promotions flag is true on the order change.

 * like {@link orderExchangeAddNewItemWorkflow} and {@link orderEditAddNewItemWorkflow}.
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to compute adjustments
 * in your custom flows.
